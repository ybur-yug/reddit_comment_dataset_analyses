There are claims of toxoplasma causing antisocial attitudes in men and promiscuity[25] (or even \\\"signs of higher intelligence\\\"[26] ) in women, and greater susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in all infected persons.[25] A 2004 study found that toxoplasma \\\"probably induce[s] a decrease of novelty seeking.\\\"\\n\\n&gt; The study suggests that male carriers have shorter attention spans, a greater likelihood of breaking rules and taking risks, and are more independent, anti-social, suspicious, jealous and morose. It also suggests that these men are deemed less attractive to women. \\n\\nI can confirm all of these changes in men.  We had like sixteen plus cats in the house at one point, and now I am one of the worst drivers I know, antisocial, break rules and take risks, suspicious, jealous and morose.  And obviously less attractive to women -- I haven't been on a date in like eight years.\\n\",\"score\":-2.397916666666,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"Being pro-life can get deadly.\",\"score\":-0.895833333333,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"The cause for Cali's problems are just so obvious and you still have brain dead liberals trying to figure out what's wrong.

You hardly feel a \\\"stranger\\\" because there are lots of other students from many backgrounds (not necessarily overseas). \\n\\n\\nI'm not the best guy when it comes to socialising, but I tend to hang around with people from Arab/Asian backgrounds, probably because percentage of students of foreign backgrounds is quite high (i would say about 40-50%) in my class. I've also noticed social circles of other languages in my place.\\n\\n\\nPart of this could be a language issue and it’s also a \\\"cultural\\\" thing. It probably makes you somewhat more comfortable dealing with people from a similar background to yours rather than others, but think people should be more open to others.\\n\\n\\nMy personal experience was good, I was about 14 when I came here and managed to settle down pretty quickly after that. I was taught some English lessons back home so it was just getting used to the accent. The school and college I joined were in a very diverse area, just two out of the 25 students in my classes were English, so that made me more confident.\\n\",\"score\":4.761607142857001,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Honestly there's no single language to learn that will uniformly fill any of those performance measures you give.  Scientists and Engineers are like anyone else and have eclectic tastes.  While there are certain languages that you will certainly get more *milage* out of, you're always picking up new languages as you go along either through curiosity or necessity. \\n\\nThat said.\\n\\nSPEED:  Most of the thoroughly debugged not-insanely-specialized high performance crunchers I've encountered are all C or Fortran.  They're both simple, a bit ugly, very terse, but incredibly powerful.  And you will encounter them often.  An often gripe is that these languages are old.  This is true.  But age brings well tested libraries and a host of already written code.  Chances are if you have a problem which needs speed someone else has probably already solved it and you can either link against or cannibalize their code which saves you precious precious time as a student/professional. \\n\\nPROTOTYPING/DEVELOPMENT:  For anything for which performance is not of the very utmost importance I use Python.  It's not the speediest but the shear quickness you can flesh out an algorithm or idea is incredible.  It's also amazingly easy to pick up.  If you need speed you can either optimize the Python, or you can recode in C or Fortran (or your other favorite language).  This saves you some headaches (you'll be debugging language issues, not algorithm implementation + language issues) and code generally benefits from rewrites anyway.\\n\\nStay away from the 3.x branch IMO, there's no real need to use it at the moment.  Packages like numpy, pylab (for an easy interface for matplotlib) and scipy (kinda buggy, some usefulness) are great.\\n\\nMATH ENVORION:  Depends on what you do.  As a physics undergrad I learned Mathemeatica because that was on the computers.  As an engineer I learned Matlab and Maple because. . they where on the computers.  If you want something that will solve nasty indefinite integrals for you then look at Maple/Mathematica (or Sage, a free frontend for free CAS software:  sagemath.org).  Most modern proprietary software suits can do a bit of everything.  Matlab CAN do symbolic stuff with maple, but it's shitty. Mathematica CAN do pure crunching, but it's comparatively slow.  \\n\\nThere's also R which is very useful if your work is driven by statistics.\",\"score\":1.1042582417589994,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"You actrually just proved that they have wmds - thanks for agreeing with me.\",\"score\":0.13571428571400004,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"Cycle through your bodily functions...

First off, I meant the devout atheist thing as a sort of joke, but let's move past that. Why people on reddit have to nitpick the smallest things is beyond me, especially when much of the time those little things are meant as sarcasm or as a joke. \\n\\nI'm not saying that I am absolutely right on the issue, I'm just stating what I believe would help the pro-life movement and what I believe to be immoral. I'm not telling a woman that she can't have a late term abortion, and I'm not saying that it should be outright outlawed, I even made special mention of an extenuating circumstance that would make late term abortion necessary. But like it or not, by the later terms of pregnancy, even when the baby is still inside of the mother, it has fully formed, it does feel pain and IMO it is fucked up to kill it. It is alive. It has a heartbeat. Define what alive is and that baby will fit your description. \\n\\nMy point is that if a woman is going to have sex (she is), she should KNOW what she would do case she gets pregnant. It would be immature to not even give thought to it. Do you honestly think it's cool to just sit around for months letting the baby form into a person inside of you while you decide whether or not to get an abortion? That is a decision that ideally should be made right away, once you know. This is a conversation that I have had with every single one of my girlfriends. That is because I am an adult and I would never tell my girlfriend what to do with her body. If a girl says she won't have an abortion or doesn't know, chances are I'm not gonna be having much sex with her because I don't want to get into this situation. Partners should be on the same page about this. Why is it wrong for me to say that people should think about this? \\n\\nI'm sorry, but there have to be some regulations on abortions. It's a democracy after all and we need to come to a middle ground, to an agreement. We can't just say that it is absolutely OK to have an abortion at any time and we can't say that it is NEVER OK to have an abortion. Those are the two extremes of the argument and I think that both of those are immoral and wrong.\\n\\nJust think. It boggles my mind how anybody wouldn't know what to do right away, how anybody would wait until late term to get an abortion. That's unfair. At a point, that fetus does become a living being, even if it hasn't experienced anything yet. \\n\\nI'm done. I won't reply anymore. Say what you want but this is the exact reason why I rarely comment on abortion, because EVERYBODY is so hard headed about this. Nobody is ever willing to follow me to that middle ground (well, sometimes, but rarely). It's attitudes like these that have made this issue such a \\\"hot button\\\" topic that will likely never come to a conclusion. People are just unreasonable. Sure, in a perfect world I would NEVER EVER even consider telling anybody what to do with their own body. But this is not a perfect world, and people have been known to do some seriously fucked up shit. So sorry, I can't say that a person can do WHATEVER they want with their body, at some point, for society to be able to function, there has to be some sort of limits set. \",\"score\":1.4147893772860005,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Polar bears and penguins, too?\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"My name is Marcus.\\n\\nA friend called me \\\"that Unrealious guy\\\" and I liked it.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius\",\"score\":0.375,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"Buttsex.\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"You wouldn't really care.\",\"score\":0.46875,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"How do you think this person got their information?

I started with a false premise, but accepted it as truth. Then I smudged the english result a bit. I'll simplify for explanation. A common example is the relationship between fire and oxygen. \\n \\n    P - There is a fire\\n    Q - There is oxygen\\n    P -&gt; Q - \\\"If there is a fire, then there is oxygen\\\"  \\nThe error that thtroyer pointed out is the attempt to assume ~P -&gt; ~Q. That is to say:  \\n\\n    ~P -&gt; ~Q - \\\"If there is NOT a fire, then there is NOT oxygen\\\"  \\nThis is clearly false. Simply because there is not a fire does not mean there is not oxygen. \\n\\nNow, this is where I made my joke. If P-&gt;Q is true, then ~Q-&gt;~P is always true. That is:  \\n\\n    ~Q -&gt; ~P - \\\"If there is NOT oxygen, then there is NOT fire.\\\"  \\nAnd this makes immediate sense. You can't have a fire without oxygen. And it works in the real world, too, because P-&gt;Q is a valid premise.\\n\\nBut if we start with a false premise \\n\\n    ~P -&gt; Q - \\\"If you do NOT believe in God, then your children will kill you\\\"  \\nand invert it  \\n\\n    ~Q -&gt; P - \\\"If your children do NOT kill you, then you believe in God\\\"  \\nyou get an equally false premise, which for the joke, I treated as true. However, this statement really just means, \\\"I can conclude that you believe in God because your children did not kill you\\\" and flows logically if you assume the start (~P-&gt;Q) was true. I could have maybe written the English form more clearly, but it's logically valid, and is no different than, \\\"I can conclude there is no fire on the moon because there is no oxygen on the moon.\\\" \\n\\nBut I chose to interpret \\\"then\\\" as we commonly do in conversational English. The statement, humorously became, \\\"It will be considered that I have belief in God if my children don't kill me\\\" or I suppose \\\"God will conclude I believe in Him if my children don't kill me.\\\" And of course the assumption of the premise \\\"If you believe in God, you will go to heaven.\\\" With this interpretation, the pathway to heaven is as simple as not falling victim to parricide. Logic allows an outside observer to infer knowledge (\\\"Oh, he must have believed in God...\\\") it doesn't make things true that aren't (\\\"Oh, I guess I believed in God without even realizing!\\\")\\n\\nRather long and probably over explained, but there you go ;)\",\"score\":-9.080685286934003,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"Oh awkward, how bad would it be if you were actually that guy?  \",\"score\":-0.058823529411999975,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"The feeling of accomplishment.

Even in their defense. We certainly should protect people from other people in some situations from themselves. \\n\\nFor example. We should not allow someone to murder other people because it takes away from the victims freedom. We should stop a child from touching a hot stove because the child is not able to rationally form an idea of what is right or wrong for them. I would apply this to adults who are not capable of sound thought. Such as severe cases of mental disability. \\n\\nHowever, there are millions upon millions of people who can think reasonably and understand the risks of of alcohol consumption. We do not stop them nor should we. As long as they are not taking away the freedom of another individual. \\n\\nAs I said in our other discussion, here is how I define freedom. Freedom is the individuals right to do anything they choose to do as long as they are not hurting anyone other than them self or someone that is willing to be hurt. \\n\\nIf Xonder and I knew each other in real life and he wanted to know what if felt like to punch someone and I volunteered my face, he could be arrested for aggravated assault. Hell, there is even a chance that I could be arrested. Is that right? We are both adults (at least I will assume Xonder is for sake of example) We are both able to reasonably make decisions concerning our well being. My face belongs to me. His fist belongs to him, no one should be able to intervene. \\n\\nI have no interest in cutting my self, but I should not presume to take away from another persons freedom if they find scarification beautiful. \\n\\nI have every interest in doing drugs. Even if it is to the point of abuse, you should not have the right to tell me what I can do with my body as long as I am not hurting anyone other than myself. \\n\\nReligions of all sorts have been pushing their idea of morality upon everyone else for thousands of years. Even up to the point of death. That is wrong.\\n\\nAgain, an individuals freedom is more important than you imposing your moralities. \\n\\nI only get this one life. I will not harm others, unless we both agree, and I will be damned if I let someone tell me what I can and can't do with my body.  \\n\\nYour moralities have no governance on my freedom.

So long as ***nothing*** on your car ***ever*** touches anything else but the tires to the road, you will be just fine. \\n\\nYOU are responsible for knowing the position and speed of every object within your action horizon. If it is in any way possible for something to intersect or interact with you, ***you must know where it is, where it's going, and be absolutely prepared for any changes it may make***. \\n\\nYour trajectory must NEVER cross the trajectory of another vehicle within a several second time window. This means no tailgaiting, don't allow yourself to be tailgated, and you must plan and prepare for any cross traffic that may occur. \\n\\nLearn to drive a stick so you can really feel your car. You don't always have to drive one, but someone who doesn't know how to drive a stick doesn't really know how to drive a car. It's like someone who needs a calculator to do basic math. \\n\\nFeel your throttle with your right foot (and flywheel with your left, if you have a clutch). Feel your brakes (***BRAKES, people, dammit, not breaks!***) with your right foot. You NEVER, EVER, EVER work the BRAKE with your left foot. \\n\\nIf you turn your wipers on, you MUST turn your headlights on, I don't know why that isn't automatic. When it's foggy, turn on your lights. If you've got a car that's color is similar to the road or the sky, turn them earlier than you would otherwise so people can see you. \\n\\nALWAYS indicate if you're going to do something which another drive may need to account for. \\n\\nIf you're turning, USE THE TURN LANE. Don't decelerate until you're IN the turn lane. You don't have to come to a complete stop to turn, you don't have to go 5mph to turn, don't drive like an old Asian lady. \\n\\nWhen making a left turn, if you have a green but not an arrow, *occupy the intersection* so that you are guaranteed to turn when the light turns yellow. This also allows other people to enter the intersection behind you so they can turn also. When I say 'occupy', I mean pull into the intersection so that your turn will be a right angle instead of a smooth curve, but don't interfere with the oncoming lane.\\n\\nOnramps are for coming up to speed. GET UP TO SPEED WHILE YOU ARE ON THE ONRAMP! Don't wait to get on the highway to get to the speed limit. \\n\\nSimilarly, offramps are for deceleration. DO NOT DECELERATE WHILE ON THE HIGHWAY! In fact, I'm going to say this - except in terms of life or death, when driving on the highways, *never* use your brakes unless you have to. If you use your brakes on the highway, it means ***you made a mistake and got too close to someone else***. Don't do that. Mistakes are dangerous.\\n\\nPlan your driving, understand your route in a dynamic sense. Don't just get in your car and stare five feet in front of your hood. Look around you at all times, know where everyone else is. If you're going a different speed than them, plot your course through them ahead of time. Create a game plan, don't figure it out play-by-play. \\n\\nSpeaking of that, the speed limit is whatever the conditions are safe for. A highway that's safe for 85 on a sunny day may not be safe for 55 in the heavy rain or even 35 in the snow. \\n\\nDo not EVER impede someone else's progress. Don't intersect with their trajectories, and DO NOT cause them to apply their brakes or alter their course. NEVER pull in front of someone if it will cause them to have to slow down. If you're going slower than someone, get behind them and leave them alone. If you're going faster, get ahead of them ASAP. If someone comes up behind you going faster than you on the highway, move to the right and STAY THERE! Never force someone to pass you on the right. \\n\\nIf you ever find yourself driving side by side with another person, all of ethics and morality compels you to SPEED UP AND PASS THEM, then MOVE OVER.\\n\\nIf you EVER find ANYONE in your rearview mirror, GET OUT OF THEIR WAY. \\n\\nFlashing your headlights at oncoming cars means \\\"cop ahead!\\\" whereas flashing your lights at the car in front of you means \\\"Get out of my way!\\\" \\n\\nIf you're on the highway in stop-and-go traffic where it creeps then everyone speeds up then it creeps again, maintain the average speed of motion at all times, allowing distance between you and the next car to grow when they speed up and shrink when it slows down. Don't ever use your brakes, you may just be idling along. But once you've exited the jam, not only are you out of it, but if you've done this properly, you ENDED the traffic jam for everyone! (This is true.)\\n\\nI guess this is more of a master's class from a connoisseur of driving. \\n\\nRemember, driving is one of the funnest video games you'll ever play, but you've only got one life on this one, and if you fuck it up, well... game over.\",\"score\":-1.4868589743600003,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"I use carpet cleaner on tough stains on my clothes.

Patents grant monopolies to inventors over their inventions, and in most every cases a monopoly isn't going to end up distribute something as cheaply or as widely as an open market would, so in general, fewer people have access to new inventions when the inventor is allowed to completely control distribution. In most cases, I would expect the wealth gained by the inventor from his patent would be dwarfed by the wealth society is giving up by not having unrestricted access (assuming the invention is actually useful), though admittedly that can be hard to quantify.\\n\\nOf course, the counterargument is to take a property rights perspective, something like, \\\"Well, society as a whole benefits more from an organic farm than a suburban housing development, so are you proposing that we seize all suburban housing developments and replace them with organic farms?\\\" And, of course, the difference is that real, physical property is different from \\\"intellectual property\\\", which is why the law makes a kind of compromise: patents have fixed, limited terms (copyrights, too, at least originally).\\n\\nPersonally, I don't believe in the concept of intellectual property, but to the extent that the concept is a reaction against plagiarism, I'm sympathetic. Plagiarism is repugnant, but at the same time, I don't think if we wiped away all intellectual property protections there would be a rash of plagiarism. People who pirate movies don't claim they created them, after all.\\n\\nIn the case of patentable inventions, it seems to me that someone who says or implies that they invented a certain product they're selling when they didn't is defrauding their customers. No need for special laws. On the other hand, if someone produces and distributes a product while giving full credit to the inventor (no plagiarism), they're going to succeed only if they can produce and distribute it more efficiently (more cheaply and widely) than the inventor can. So for the inventor to then try to force them to stop distributing the product, the inventor has to say, \\\"Everyone has to be forced to deal with my high prices and shortages because it was my idea.\\\" Not cool.\\n\\nWhat I haven't brought up is the idea that certain things would never be invented if the inventor didn't have an expectation of profit provided by intellectual property protection, either because of high R&amp;D costs or some other reason. It's hard to argue with that, because it's pretty much impossible to prove or disprove. In the same spirit, I could say that there's a huge set of inventions that aren't being invented right now because they involve some kind of infringing derivation of existing patented inventions. Or what about the inventions that aren't being invented because some previous, patented invention is still so profitable? The patent system would seem to encourage inventors to look for a jackpot and then milk it for as long as they can rather than steadily improve technology.\\n\\nDrug companies are the standard example for the \\\"wouldn't be invented\\\" argument, because the costs of developing and testing a new drug are so high. I guess there's not a silver bullet for slaying that argument. All I can say is that we might be better off if drugs were being developed by people motivated by healing rather than profit, with research funded by charity, universities and perhaps industry coalitions rather than individual drug manufacturers working in secret. In that case, the drugs that did end up being invented would at least be beneficial and affordable.\",\"score\":4.828205128205001,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"&gt;Then why aren't fundamentalists excommunicated or defrocked or ostracized or whatever the equivalent is.\\n\\n&gt;I'm sorry, but until the religious take responsibility for their own, then they all get painted with the same brush.

The first rule of fight-with-venomous-snakes-club is stay as far away from it as possible.  If you get too close, then it just becomes a matter of odds as to whether your wife will have to rush you to the hospital, because they can move and strike more quickly than you can react.  Although if you're living in an area where venomous snakes are common, having the appropriate antivenom on hand is not unusual.\\n\\nTo deal with it from a safe enough distance, use something like a broom - something with a long handle, but you don't want the end to be too bushy or soft, because you need to be able to pin the snake down with it.\\n\\nThe way to control a snake is to pin it just behind the head - that's where snake handlers hold them, too.  Assuming you're not talking about a huge snake, the rest of its body won't do much once the head is controlled.  Even if it does thrash a bit, if you hold tight it's not a threat.  \\n\\nSo, you first use the broom to pin it down.  The details of vary depending on whether it's facing you or trying to escape.  If it's trying to escape, it may be fairly easy to pin down if you're behind it and it doesn't see the broom coming.  If it's facing you, it'll probably be poised in a defensive posture - reared up and hood open, if it's a cobra - but if you remain still, they won't typically try to attack, they're trying to scare you off.  If you stick the broom out in front of you, fairly high, you can lower the broom head down from above and behind the snake's head and it won't realize what's happening in time to escape.  Of course it might not work the first time... always be ready to retreat, but you probably don't need to be told that.\\n\\nOnce it's pinned, if the head can still move around, you need to pin it closer to the head - a second implement might help with that, but I've done this three or four times and managed with a single broom. \\n\\nOnce it's under control, you get to the unpleasant part, if you're like me and don't enjoy killing animals.  I've always used an axe, and just chopped off the head - it's quick, and reliable, and probably about as painless for the snake as it gets.  You could use a big knife, too, i.e. something that will do it quickly and cleanly.\\n\\nI should add that ideally, I wouldn't kill a snake.  But when there's one in your kitchen and your wife is behaving like a damsel in distress, there's a tendency to want a final solution.  Also, if you don't have the proper equipment handy, caging it and transporting it safely can be tricky.\\n\\nAlso, it's a good idea to be familiar with the types of snakes in the area you're in, since they vary in habits, and of course not all are dangerous to humans.  Plus, some cobras can spit or spray venom up to six feet or so, so to tangle with one of those you need to wear eye protection.\\n\",\"score\":-12.300755494503997,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"Bollocks, it was a murderer.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrorism is affording it a more dignity than it deserves.\",\"score\":0.583333333333,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"I found this quite exciting, can anyone recommend a well written retrospective on classic hacking?\",\"score\":1.341666666667,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"The link between low testosterone and mental function.\",\"score\":-0.7625,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"dude something tells me she left those footprints earlier walking...

I did not realize the connection between the brain and the mind was a philosophical question in this day and age.

I actually explicitly stated I am NOT a professional in neurobiology.  I just pointed out your unwillingness to educate yourself before engaging someone in a \\\"discussion\\\".\\n\\n&gt; People should not have the attitude that there are professionals out there in every field who need to be listened to, and whose ideas are to be trusted.\\n\\nAgain, did not say that.  Just said that your unwillingness to learn the basic stuff before attempting to foist a model on someone makes the discussion frustrating.\\n\\n&gt; Are you a person who believes in this idea that one should \\\"trust the experts\\\" in various areas? You appear to be a very deep thinking person - and you would no doubt understand how there is this constant reassessment going on in all the different fields. Science is process and not product.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I do know what Science is, since I practice it for a living.  Over the years, I have seen many experts proven wrong. I have also seen a lot of undergrads and graduate students come up with ideas that are obviously wrong if you give it even a little bit of thought or read the literature.  Unfortunately, the frequency at which an expert is proved wrong is significantly lower than that of a novice.  Over the years you also come to the realization that you cannot help a person who believes that knowledge is not important only thought is sufficient.  In the vast majority of science in the last century or more, thought without knowledge of the basic underlying science has not proven to be winning strategy.  So I don't implicitly trust an expert but with an expert I at least can ask for proof, which s/he will be obliged to provide.\\n\\nAlso, in my life I have often had to change my hypotheses.  I have no issues with that - least of all, when it is field I have very little knowledge of, like neurobiology.\\n\\n&gt; Everybody needs to learn how to think critically and independently.\\n\\nYes.  Unfortunately science requires both that as well as knowledge.  You stated a hypothesis that is incorrect based on the data in the field.  You are not aware of the data and are unwilling to read it.  So how far do yo think you will get with just thinking about it? Maybe far in philosophy but not science.\\n\\n&gt; Frankly, I believe that people in different academic fields get into a group-think situation. Everybody goes and studies the models and theories of the previous generation. College in the Usa, at least, is not about learning how to think critically, oneself, about something. It's more about learning the trade as it is handed down to you.\\n\\nAll this maybe true - which it is not, at the graduate level (where serious research is done).

Is death truly the moral choice?  Would you choose death over life?\\n\\nObviously, I would do everything in my power to prevent such a situation from happening in the first place, and I would do everything in my power to prevent such a situation from happening again.  In no way do I desire the death of another human being for whatever reason.  In no way do I desire to be put in a situation where I must weigh the consequences of a multitude of evil choices.\\n\\nWhat you ultimately fail to understand is that the true evil isn't the person forced to make the choice in the end, but the person who created the situation to begin with.\",\"score\":0.9299908424940004,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Far Cry 2 is my game of choice when stoned\",\"score\":0.28125,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"You are a dying breed.

You'd be shocked how many million dollar pieces of lab equipment are integrated with computer hardware from twenty years ago. (It's not simple to upgrade the hardware, either . . . sure, buying a new PC would be cheap, but the board to interface with the equipment is usually proprietary and legacy.) Long story short . . . Someone is going to need to know C, and have some skill with low-level programming. A lot of the software to interface with more esoteric lab equipment is going to be custom-written by necessity. Generally, it's going to be a grad student doing the programming, and if you have serious skills in this arena, professors will *fight* over you. Plus, of course you're still going to need something for quick one-off calculations and modeling (there's *always* some modeling involved). For this, plenty of people get by with just a symbolic package Mathematica/MATLAB (my vote is for Mathematica), but Python seems like a solid choice as well.\\n\\nFor theoretical/computational work, the requirements are quite different. Here, you're looking to write large-scale, performance-intense simulations. Python isn't a *bad* choice for this, but (like or not) it does have some performance problems. More importantly, though, it doesn't have a lot of history in the field. The name of the game here is Fortran, as others have already said. You can find scientific computing libraries for *everything under the sun* in Fortran, which makes up for some of its deficiencies in rapid application development when compared to more modern languages. Plus, it's about as bare-metal fast as C, but with a focus on array manipulation and complex mathematical operations that make it particularly well suited for scientific work. And, of course, there's all the history; most of the old-guard \\\"speak\\\" Fortran as a first language when they program, and it's pretty ingrained in the physics world. (You'll read journal articles with pseudocode that is pretty much valid Fortran.) Most physicists I know have at least some working knowledge of Fortran (or one of its derivatives, like [IDL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDL_(programming_language)), so it's also kind of a *lingua franca*.\\n\\nSo . . . almost no matter what, it's a good idea to know Python. You're also going to want to be very familiar with a symbolic math package, which could mean Mathematica, MATLAB, Maple, or more Python (if you go for something like SAGE) . . . but be aware that Mathematica and MATLAB are far more popular than the alternatives, and Mathematica is arguably the most powerful. Then, it diverges -- if you're going to be doing experimental work, you'll want to learn C, and get familiar with low-level hardware integration. If you're doing computational work, learn Fortran.\\n\\nEDIT: Forgot about R. For some reason, I've never really used it, or heard many physics folks talking about it (though my friends doing econometrics used to rave about it). Still, it is probably a good idea to either learn R, or to learn the scripting language for a powerful data analysis package (Origin, Igor, etc.).\",\"score\":3.46786926309,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"The above is a corollary to [this observation](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8oozs/askreddit_new_to_cats_just_got_my_own_any_words/c09yffp).\",\"score\":-0.25,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"The only reason I was skeptical was because I was under the impression that the docs just cut off the umbilical cord, causing the baby to starve.\\n\\nIn any case, my opinion on this matter doesn't depend on religion or whether the fetus is alive.

You're getting older. Your friends/peers/other social groups aren't listening to new music, so you're not. The social group you belong to identifies with a particular kind of music that just isn't being made anymore. No one is ever going to sound just like Zeppelin or Hendrix again without being boring cookie-cutter copies. Same goes for any decade you care to mention.\\n\\n2. Music executives have dialed back on new ideas, preferring to stick with \\\"sure things,\\\" which are always recycled versions of the same old thing. So the stuff that appears on The USA Today or other popular culture venues is going to be image-heavy, highly refined pop music that is going to be much the same as it was in, oh, 1960, or any other time.\\n\\n3.

There are usually *no real significant differences* from one year's music to the next. People are *always* recycling styles of music and adding new twists on them. Blues musicians had African influences. Elvis was simply ripping off blues musicians, as was Led Zeppelin (in some cases they stole songs wholesale!); the Beatles started off by copying the bubblegum style that was around at the time, and only incrementally began innovating. Brian Wilson made important recording advancements with \\\"Good Vibrations,\\\" but the music itself in that song is still the same old Beach Boys, which is itself a kind of barbershop quartet. Bands from the 80s were probably the most innovative by introducing new instruments (synth) into the mix, but it all evolved directly out of punk (post-punk) and disco influences, and punk in turn was simply a reaction to progressive rock.... and the list goes on. For every \\\"new genre\\\" you can think of, it came directly from the musicians incorporating elements from one or more sources and then adding a twist. \\n\\nNew music that is innovative is still out there, but you can say that it all came from old stuff anyway. (here are some popular bands) Vampire Weekend has a lot of Paul Simon in it. The Hold Steady made a conscious effort to sound like The Band and Springsteen. Deerhoof has a lot of Flaming Lips and early 90s rock influence. TV on the Radio has some of Peter Gabriel's sounds. The Decemberists sound a lot like Jethro Tull.

Canada exports roughly 20 million tonnes of wheat per year.\\n\\nhttp://www.kltprc.net/foresight/Chpt_21.htm\\n\\n&gt;Conclusions\\n\\n&gt;Despite the merits of hemp fiber and oil, the global market has been on a downward trend and remains negligible in magnitude. Total world trade in hemp fiber and seed amounted to only $10.4 million in 1996! Processing costs are one of the largest obstacles the hemp industry faces. For example, bleached softwood pulp currently sells for about $800 (U.S.) per ton compared to hemp pulp at about $2,100 (U.S.) per ton. New processing technology must be found for hemp to be cost competitive.\\n\\n&gt;Hemp profits also suffer from price volatility. Projected hemp demand, coupled with a low volume market, makes profit estimations adventurous. At current world prices it does not appear that hemp can compete on a large scale and may be confined to a specialty market until processing technology improves.\\n\\n&gt;None of the large multinationals has openly supported hemp legalization in the United States. Why? Corporate America has the capacity to invest in hemp production and processing facilities all around the world. They have access to plenty of raw material and low labor costs (China and Eastern Europe) and a stable economic and political environment where hemp production is legal (the European Union). But investment in hemp processing remains negligible. For example, there are only about 20 paper mills worldwide that use hemp as a fiber source, which produce about 0.05 percent of the world’s annual paper production volume.\\n\\n&gt;Again, it must be emphasized that hemp production is not the problem. It is the challenge of improving hemp processing that will open the doors of cost competitiveness. If the large multinationals can’t make hemp work in the marketplace, what type of costs and return differentials might small farmers and businesses work towards? That is the crux of the great hemp debate.\",\"score\":-3.730357142857,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"I wouldn't take the article too seriously.

In terms of instruction decoding, the complexity of x86 is not as much of a problem as one would think, as most of the old useless instructions are relegated to microcode (e.g. VectorPath on K7-K10 chips).\",\"score\":1.248214285714,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"but every time i masturbate i'm killing my children\",\"score\":1.0625,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"i just smell good. that is all.\",\"score\":1.050137362637,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"So I just got around to watching my copy of the Mist (Stephen King fan, but who in Maine isn't?) for the first time.

You mention public outrage as grounds for not following-through with TARP and bailouts.  With all due respect, \\\"public opinion\\\" is irrelevant, in that the average American doesn't know anything about \\\"banking\\\".  You should know that.  If you don't, walk up to a random person on the street and ask them about TARP.  (They won't even know what you are talking about.)  I do acknowledge that the TARP effort has been mismanaged/\\\"porked\\\", but TARP is not the only bailout/stimulus effort on the table.  The question is:  Has the overall bailout/stimulus effort successfully avoided a global financial meltdown.  And I think the general consensus is \\\"yes\\\".  RP would have proposed to not do anything.  And I believe the general consensus is that no action (as proposed by RP) would have resulted in a global financial meltdown.\\n\\n2.  The invasion was illegal.  Absolutely.  I am not disputing that.  And you are correct, the region has been in turmoil for 5000 years.  But none of that is at issue.  At issue (like it or not) is the price of oil (and jobs).  Pulling out of the illegal war would (likely) trigger an Israeli/Arab (nuclear) war.  In addition to all the western oil companies losing their (illegal) rights to Iraqi oil fields (resulting in massive losses and lost jobs), the price of oil would skyrocket and businesses would fail world wide.  These results (combined) would have sent America (and the world) into financial meltdown unlike (I believe) the world has ever seen.  Again, I am not disputing that the war was/is illegal.  I am just saying that RP's proposal to immediately pull out would have devastated the world's companies - which is significantly more irrepressible than sticking around to clean up the mess of the illegal invasion.\\n\\n3.  I agree.  The government is totally bloated and inefficient.  But I don't believe it's responsible to scale-back quickly.  The growth has taken a century.  The scale-back should be responsibly planned and executed over the next 30 - 50 years.  (We are talking about shifting hundreds of thousands of jobs form the public sector to the private sector.  We are talking about eliminating billion dollar subsidies to corn farmers in Iowa - on which  an entire state is dependent.  We are talking about decreasing the size of America's military budget by how much ?  50% ?  That would eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs (directly), and millions (indirectly).  And without unemployment benefits (which is another RP proposal), all of these people would turn to crime to survive.  (Thankfully RP support the right to bare arms, because you'll need them - assuming you are one of the lucky ones who still has a job and can afford a gun.)  And that's just the beginning.\\n\\nI appreciate your thoughts.  And again, I am not saying that RP's proposals are bad.  All I am saying is that his proposals require decades to responsibly accommodate.  \\n\\nFurther, it is my strong belief that there were some immediate fires that needed some attention:  Banking failures, and two failed wars.  In both cases, I don't think anyone truly believes the best thing to do is to simply walk away.  The results would have been devastating.  The last 4 - 5 Administrations have left us holding way too many balls.  We can't just walk away, else everything will simply come crashing down - and that serves no one's interest.  \\n\\nBottom line:  We need to spend some more money (and probably a lot more money) first, before we can starting putting the balls down safely.  The real question becomes, \\\"Can Obama actually set the Federal Government on a course that will follow-through with an eventual dismantling?\\\"  He has already acknowledged that \\\"we are out of money\\\".

When I speak of divinity, I mean to say that I believe in a type of allness or root conscience that I tie with the concept of \\\"I AM.\\\"  I also believe that reality, perception of whatever this root being is, is entirely subjective for each individual sentient being though.  Because of that, each must seek happiness in its own way.  I do put myself forward as holding belief in Christ, but in a very abstract way.  I think the call for undiscerning altruism attributed to the Christ-concept was meant as an argument to point out that the distinction between self and other is false, that if we are created in the image of the divine then to a certain degree we are unlimited, undifferentiated beings.  If we are undifferentiated, then when any being is suffering then (in a sense) we are all suffering and should seek to mitigate it as promptly as possible.  To me, if you're going to claim to be somehow fashioned after some divine force then you only box in and isolate your idea of your own spirit, and by doing so blind yourself to the root need of yielding peacefulness, by making the conceptualization of that divinity into some sort of distant, angry old man.  I feel like what ought to be a call towards the ultimate freeing of the conditioned self and others has been turned into nothing more than a tool with which to reinforce social hierarchies.  I don't want to abandon Christian spiritualism entirely, but it's becoming harder and harder for me to identify with any other people who consider themselves Christians.  This is especially true considering I've lived in Alabama my whole life, and all of my family is either Southern Baptist or Church of Christ.

In the contemporary context of cultural relativism and religious pluralism the number of non-baptized infants has grown considerably, and therefore the reflection on the possibility of salvation for these infants has become urgent. The Church is conscious that this salvation is attainable only in Christ through the Spirit. But the Church, as mother and teacher, cannot fail to reflect upon the fate of all men, created in the image of God, and in a more particular way on the fate of the weakest members of the human family and those who are not yet able to use their reason and freedom.\\n\\n&gt; It is clear that the traditional teaching on this topic has concentrated on the theory of limbo, understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism, and who, therefore, neither merit the beatific vision, nor yet are subjected to any punishment, because they are not guilty of any personal sin. This theory, elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages, never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium, even if that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council. It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis. However, in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (1992), the theory of limbo is not mentioned. Rather, the Catechism teaches that infants who die without baptism are entrusted by the Church to the mercy of God, as is shown in the specific funeral rite for such children. The principle that God desires the salvation of all people gives rise to the hope that there is a path to salvation for infants who die without baptism (cf. CCC, 1261), and therefore also to the theological desire to find a coherent and logical connection between the diverse affirmations of the Catholic faith: the universal salvific will of God; the unicity of the mediation of Christ; the necessity of baptism for salvation; the universal action of grace in relation to the sacraments; the link between original sin and the deprivation of the beatific vision; the creation of man “in Christ”.\\n\\n&gt; The conclusion of this study is that there are theological and liturgical reasons to hope that infants who die without baptism may be saved and brought into eternal happiness, even if there is not an explicit teaching on this question found in Revelation. However, none of the considerations proposed in this text to motivate a new approach to the question may be used to negate the necessity of baptism, nor to delay the conferral of the sacrament. Rather, there are reasons to hope that God will save these infants precisely because it was not possible to do for them that what would have been most desirable— to baptize them in the faith of the Church and incorporate them visibly into the Body of Christ.\\n\\nWith that said, I actually tend to favor the idea of Limbo: that unbaptized infants with no personal sin go to a place (technically hell) of pure natural happiness, without receiving the beatific.  But if God chooses to grant the beatific vision to these infants in ways He hasn't revealed to us, all the more to the glory of His mercy.\",\"score\":8.539087301587001,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"Me.

There's a lot of music these days that sound very similar from year to year.\\n\\nI would argue that the biggest advancements in music came not from individual artists, but the invention and distribution of the tools to make it. \\n\\nOnce people could multi-track, the Beatles blew everybody's mind (Sgt. Pepper was done with a four[**4!**]-track). \\n\\nOnce synthesizers came into their own and became both programmable, synchronized, and possible to maintain, entire new worlds opened up (prog, disco, electronic, hip hop). Hell, you could call effects pedals signal processors and add funk and metal in here, too.\\n\\nOnce random-access recording was made, people could create both perfect takes and more and more complex performances that wouldn't have been possible. This can be used for evil (auto-tune) or good (mashups, IDM, anything of a granular nature).\\n\\nIt's how people used these tools that people saw their ideas of \\\"what music is\\\" change.\\n\\nThe most recent invention has been on accessibility and distribution, and has only been around for ten years. Think about it: these days, any kid with their parents' iMac and access to the internet can download any number of NLEs, samples, programs, and plugins, and make something that really speaks to them. Just like there's going to be a blog for 20-something ex-pats in Japan with a libertarian bent, there's going to be some band playing just the music you want to hear (cue Chris Anderson's knowing chuckle).\\n\\nPersonally, I feel we're currently in a musical ouroboros. But the great thing is that everybody's got their own thing that they wouldn't have been able to get into just a decade ago. In this post, you've got people talking about awesome screamo, death metal, mashups, Animal Collective hipster-type music, whatever.\\n\\nSo, uh. I don't think I answered your question.

Last September I could run a mile in 6:45 and two miles in 15:30, which I considered spectacular for myself.\\n\\nRunning is certainly stressful on your legs.  I've heard it recommended to accompany a running regimen with leg weight training.  I don't do any weight training, but I have been running about 3 miles 3-4 times a week for the past few springs and summers.  I am nothing close to a fitness expert, and far from athletic even, but having run an average amount and actually noticed improvements (both in running performance and physical appearance), I'll give you my best advice.\\n\\nWhen I first started running, my lungs and heart would kill me long before my legs would get a workout.  I would rarely get much soreness, but I just couldn't run much more than a mile or two at any decent pace.  What I discovered is that *lengthening my stride* solved this problem.  My legs would really get a workout, and though my heart and lungs would still get tired, I could go at more satisfying pace, and I could go far enough that it felt like a real workout.  \\n\\nIf you can, I would try running on of those padded tracks like around a high school football field.  Schools often leave those open to the public during the day.  It's boring to run in circles, but you might give it a try to see if it helps.  Otherwise, if there's anywhere with a dirt trail, or even gravel as long as it's not so rough you might roll an ankle.  This slightest bit of \\\"padding\\\" is way better than running on pavement.  As for actual running form, I think deliberately lengthening your stride may be the key.  If your stride is the right length, you can't help but make contact with the heel and roll onto the rest of the foot.\\n\\nInterestingly, this summer I on a whim decided to bike daily instead of my usual running.  I literally haven't biked more than a few blocks since I was a little kid.  I immediately noticed the more intense leg workout it gives over running.  I started biking about 6 miles a day 2 weeks ago, which didn't take long, and have worked up to 10 or 12.  I still feel like I get a pretty decent workout, maybe not burning as many calories as running, and it certainly takes more time, but it feels great to get a different kind of workout than what I'm used to.\",\"score\":11.037133699635001,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Lean on the snowball effect.

Indeed, when Henry Ford designed the Model T, it was his expectation that ethanol, made from renewable biological materials, would be a major automobile fuel. However, gasoline emerged as the dominant transportation fuel in the early twentieth century because of the ease of operation of gasoline engines with the materials then available for engine construction, a growing supply of cheaper petroleum from oil field discoveries, and intense lobbying by petroleum companies for the federal government to maintain steep alcohol taxes. Many bills proposing a National energy program that made use of Americas vast agricultural resources (for fuel production) were killed by smear campaigns launched by vested petroleum interests. One noteworthy claim put forth by petrol companies was that the U.S. government's plans \\\"robbed taxpayers to make farmers rich\\\". \\r\\n\\r\\nGasoline had many disadvantages as an automotive resource. The \\\"new\\\" fuel had a lower octane rating than ethanol, was much more toxic (particularly when blended with tetra-ethyl lead and other compounds to enhance octane), generally more dangerous, and contained threatening air pollutants. Petroleum was more likely to explode and burn accidentally, gum would form on storage surfaces and carbon deposits would form in combustion chambers of engines. Pipelines were needed for distribution from \\\"area found\\\" to \\\"area needed\\\". Petroleum was much more physically and chemically diverse than ethanol, necessitating complex refining procedures to ensure the manufacture of a consistent \\\"gasoline\\\" product. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, despite these environmental flaws, fuels made from petroleum have dominated automobile transportation for the past three-quarters of a century. There are two key reasons: First, cost per kilometer of travel has been virtually the sole selection criteria. Second, the large investments made by the oil and auto industries in physical capital, human skills and technology make the entry of a new cost-competitive industry difficult. ---\\r\\n\\r\\nhttp://www.hempcar.org/ford.shtml\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"score\":-2.387499999999,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"twilight princess was brown and grey with lots of bloom. it made me miss windwaker terribly. here's hoping for another \\\"celda\\\"\",\"score\":1.25,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Yes, they were all up in their little fetal baby chairs up in the jasper-lined halls of heaven, plotting how to take him down, because in heaven, job #1 is revenge!\",\"score\":0.5375,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"I've just listened to that song three times in a row now.

If you don't believe in their cause, they're a terrorist. I don't agree with him so in my opinion he's a terrorist, but then again, do you really mean to call this man a freedom fighter? He's not fighting for freedom, he's fighting AGAINST personal freedom. He's fighting to impose his belief on others. So he logically can't be a freedom fighter. I mean, in some really fucked up solipsistic moral world he could be, if the freedoms he fights for is his own personal freedom to do whatever he wants, but that doesn't make sense.  Since your own argument constructs the dualism either you're a freedom fighter or a terrorist, then he's necessarily a terrorist. Thanks for proving our point.\\n\\nAnd you're wrong anyway, there is such a thing as terrorism. Freedom fighters are obliged to follow just war philosophies and only engage targets of value, or actual enemy combatants. In asymmetric warfare, which is essentially what most revolutions or freedom fighting consist of, civilians are ignored and attempts to inflict as few unnecessary innocent casualties as possible are made. Now the argument that might be used is that this doctor was a combatant in the asymmetric war over termination of unwanted pregnancies, but that would be an invalid cause of action, as the war this man is attempting to wage, does not meet the criteria of just war. While they might claim to have right intention due to their attempt to intercede on behalf of a third party, it is not the woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy that they attack or raise their dispute with. Rather, they attack an unrelated third party, such as a doctor, the implement of her decision, or the government, who allows the woman the freedom to take action. In essence, in order for their to be a just war, they must attack the party responsible for the injustice they are attempting to right or prevent. Until they directly target those, the war is in no way a war, and is instead terrorism. This demonstrates the injustice of their actions without even addressing the flash-point issues of whether or not a fetus has rights, and whether or not they would if they existed super-cede the rights of its creator and supporter, which make it in no way clear that a war against women who select termination would be in any way just. Most likely, it would not due to the principle of proportionality. If you target women who have abortions, you are causing significantly greater demonstrable harm, than you can demonstrate you have prevented. All arguments against termination revolve around subject speculation about the unknowable future potential of the fetus, the immediate harm and subjective experience the fetus has (which is also unknowable), and the objective moral \\\"wrongness\\\" of the act ie killing a human. The last is the only possible troublesome one, but since it is not objectively and universally wrong to kill a human, it could not be objectively and universally wrong to terminate a pregnancy, even if a fetus were human, which is subject to much disagreement.\",\"score\":-2.2538843101330004,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/8ona3/bad_news_for_ibm_and_apple_pic/c09ydgo\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"I'd enjoy some .bmp's. \",\"score\":0.625,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"The cat at the end was like \\\"WTF is he doin'?\\\"\",\"score\":-0.25,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"\\\"Good meditational music\\\" is kind of vague - answers range from \\\"nothing\\\" to \\\"anything\\\".

To make a long story short I'll cut to the end. I find myself very anti-religious now, but I am still spititual as ever. The church is not what I call the word of God anymore. In fact I think God would be quite disappointed. The worst thing I think you can do in God's eye is to use God to promote one's self gain while condeming others.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow about the Bible: It's time to throw it away! Wow..., I know that sounds radical. I have read it more times than any other book. I read it cover to cover several times. I seem to find a different message that way instead of cherry picking it to suit my own needs as the church does. I know what it says. It isn't a Da Vinci code. It's a manual. I figured out how it says to live life so it's time to go out and live it. Not spend my life stuck in the instuction manual. Should there be a question along the way, I don't need to return to the manual. I simply do what the manual says. Ask! Simply ask and you will receive your answer. God will tell you. He promised he would. Don't expect a telegram from Western Union with the answer, but be willing to accept in the form it comes in. It's wild sometimes. The epithany you have comes in such a form that it could only have come from God.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow let me tell you my favorite Bible story that describes religion as a whole. This story really tells it all:\\r\\n\\r\\nA man was outside a church, crying his eyes out and was obviously very sad. It seems he didn't agree with everything the church stould for so they kicked him out. (sound familiar?)\\r\\nAnyway..., God saw him and called out from the heavens:\\r\\n\\r\\n \\\"What's wrong my son? Why are you so sad?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe man told God what had happened and then shouted back:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"They won't let me in!\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGod started laughing, which surprised the man.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Why are you laughing my Lord?\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGod answered: \\\"Ha..., They won't let me in either.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nTo summarize: God's message is so much simpler than religion makes it. Just honor God and treat others as you would have them treat you. It's that simple.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don't need the church.

Even if just by a tiny amount.  Since so many people around here understand things only when they're framed in explicitly religious ways, I don't have much choice but to use that sort of language to try to get through the dense walls that have been made.  Here's an example of a flier I'm thinking about putting up around UA:\\n\\n\\n\\nCHRISTIANS\\n\\nHow can we support hierarchical religious or secular institutions when we are taught by Christ to “beware the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod” (Mark 8:15), and that “whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant” (Matthew 20:26)?\\n\\nHow can we associate with any institution which uses any form of violence to perpetuate its own being (e.g., the state) when we are explicitly and without exception taught to turn the other cheek, to love our enemies, and to pray for our persecutors (Matthew 5:38-48)? Can we truly reconcile the acceptance of concepts like “deterrent force” with belief in one who could have destroyed the world yet faced death peacefully, even taking the opportunity to teach his followers that “all who take the sword will perish by the sword” (Matthew 26:51-54)?\\n\\nHow can we be complicit in the perversion of faith into something that binds into something that liberates? Are many preachers today – those who are so ready to point fingers and so willing to turn places of worship into nothing more than anchor stores – really any better than the Pharisees, Sadducees, and scribes who sought to bind men with senseless tradition (Matthew 15:10-14, Matthew 16:6-12, Matthew 23: 1-36) and who provoked Christ himself by turning the temple into a marketplace (Mark 11:15-18)? As it was then, many still abuse the faith of others by using it to fuel the same sort of desire for status that we are taught to renounce.\\n\\nHow can we set science up as being necessarily in opposition to faith? It is by God’s unfolding of wisdom and love through nature that we may learn to make whole again all who are in need. Could each discovery that better illustrates our relationship to this world and to those we share it with not be seen as a revelation of sorts, allowing us a better articulated approach to the divine through a more full understanding of God’s own handiwork? When we demonize those things that provide practical hope to so many people, how is it really any different from those who accused Christ of performing miracles through the power of Satan? As long as we resist the most obvious forces of good provided us, we will remain a house divided – “and every city or house divided against itself will not stand” (Matthew 12:22-30).\\n\\nLIBERTY, EQUALITY, SOLIDARITY\\n\\nChristians for Peace &amp; Social Justice\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe header and footer should be in the center.

I basically save every cent I make so I can go back to my old schedule again as soon as possible. \\n\\nBut I would like to add another idea which is that it's not so much about the number of hours as it is about having control over your schedule.

If I could set my own hours, I wouldn't mind working eighty hours a week. \\n\\nThe idea of a flexible schedule saves money on dozens of fronts.

It's as though we're pretending there is no such thing as the electric light. Why does that have to be the case in 2009?\\n\\nAnd electricity usage is another issue that gets addressed here. Our power infrastructure is already based on a twenty four hour system and yet we enforce a mandatory schedule where people have to work in the day and sleep at night which makes our power distributing system inefficient. Here we're talking about basic down-to-earth savings of important economic resources like roads and power that could be had while simultaneously improving people's work experience simply by letting people adjust their schedules beyond nine to  five.  \\n\\nAnd what about architecture. Why can't we have smaller class sizes in schools? Well, facilities cost money, right? Why not use those facilities all night long to offer classes for students and teachers who are comfortable with a late night schedule. Having more people on campus throughout the night would even reduce security expenses. The benefits are huge and yet this whole simple idea seems to be beyond most people's comprehension. \\n\\nI think part of it is that day people assume that everyone should be like they are because they have been taught that they are normal. But it's like letting the right handed people decide that leftys are weirdos who need to be brought under control. What's up with that? There are night people in this world and if you ask a group of college students if they would be interested in a class schedule that extends past 3:00AM, you will find a sizable minority willing to volunteer.  \\n\\n\",\"score\":4.492925824176,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"ah, you can justify whatever you want when it comes to religion, in some fashion or degree, depending on your position.\",\"score\":1.125,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"FedEx\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"Strike that.

Please notice also that everybody else had also 1024 parents just 10 generation ago.\\nAmazing number of combinations in just 10 generations. And 20 generations ago you had 1024*1024 parents.\\n\\n2) Small mutation big difference - Genes are much like recipes. A tiny change in\\nrecipe can cause a huge difference in the result. (often disastrous but not always) \\nMinor change could cause any organ to double or multiply. Much like an organ\\nthat has a siamese twin organ.\\n\\n3) Recessive genes - Recessive genes allow you to pass on genes which do not cause\\nany physical trait in you, but may do so in your grand children.\\nYou may have have brown eyes, normal color vision, almost normal red cells, but you\\nmay carry recessive blue eyes gene, color blindness gene and cicle cell anemia gene\\n(which has negative impact if doubled, but protects from malaria).\\nAll these traits may physically appear in your child or grandchild, and be recessive again\\nin the next generation. \\nCombining several recessive traits for the first time in a new individual might cause\\na large surprising non-gradual change.\\n\\nEvolution has these and many similar tricks in its sleeve, which make it much more efficient\\nthan you might initially think.\\n\\nThe colour of cave animals\\n\\nRandom noise of mutations will quickly destroy any traits that are not selected for.\\nJust like in the game of \\\"Chinese whispers\\\" or \\\"Broken telephone\\\".\\nOr if there is a line in a recipe that does not have any effect on the \\nresulting cake, nobody will notice if it is accidentally left out in a copy.\\n\\nIf it is a an expensive ingredient, and does not have any positive effect on the cake, the recipes without it are more likely to be copied.\",\"score\":-4.502976190476,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"zomg 300 year old flame wars\",\"score\":-0.25,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"that's what she said\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"As has been noted, the far right nuts call themselves that.

There are other accounts as well.\\n\\nSo either you're a troll, or you're a complete fucking moron who has the gall to write up a post chastising others for believing information like sheep without doing even the tiniest bit of research into the subject yourself.  I'm hoping troll, because the alternative makes me sad.\\n\\nEDIT: Thinking on this, do you have any evidence for this statement: \\n\\n&gt;The \\\"Western World\\\" thought that people were routinely shot on streets in the USSR (any many Americans still think so today).\\n\\nBecause one of the ways we knew about what was going on in the Soviet Union was...through survivor accounts like that of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his famous *The Gulag Archipelago*.  \\n\\nI'm all for questioning the story we're presented but seriously, you're just an idiot.  Horrible things *were* going on in the USSR, and we knew because, among other things we had direct accounts.  Same for NK.

No matter where that harm may come from, be it self inflicted or inflicted by another person.  I firmly believe that in every case, every attempt should be made to reduce the possibility harm occuring to a person, to the maximum extent possible, erring on the side of caution, even if it means reducing a person's liberty to some degree.  \\n  \\nNot every adult is fully capable of making their own decisions for themselves, indeed, many people need to be infantilized and appropriately so they are.  There are a wide variety of circumstances whereby a person can be deemed unfit to have their own \\\"power of attorney\\\", in which case that power is given to another person to look after them and make critical decisions for the person who is no longer capable of deciding for themself.  \\n  \\nJust because a person becomes a certain age, say 18, or 21, doesn't necessarily mean that *everybody* should have the liberty, the freedom to make extremely reckless choices.  Why?  Because hopefully as they get older, more experienced and wiser they will realize the foolishness of taking extreme risks which endanger a person's life.  Because the risk of death is too high for a person to put their own life in jeopardy for trivial gain.. say, to get high.. or to get an endorphin or adrenaline rush.  \\n  \\nCertain activities are simply too dangerous, like playing Russian Roulette, but why is that unacceptable when bungee jumping, skydiving and all sorts of other dangerous activities are considered acceptable?  I'd say part of it is because every possible step to ensure safety is taken.  \\n  \\nIn bungee jumping the lines must be carefully inspected and rated for safety, in skydiving the parachutes are very carefully contructed and inspected each and every time to ensure maximum safetey, in drag racing the cars are required by regulations to have steel reinforced safety cages and roll bars, in addition to fireproof jumpsuits, helmets and a whole host of other safety requirements.  \\n  \\nBut with Russian Roulette, there is very little safety feature, you pull that trigger, there's a very good chance you are going to die.  What if the prize for playing after 5 pulls was $1 million, or $10 million? what then?  At some point does the incentive outweigh the risk of death?  I don't think so.  \\n  \\nI have made a lot of foolish mistakes in my life, even recently, I experimented with drugs and nearly OD'd several times.  I can tell you right now that the high was NOT worth it.  The long term, permanent damage that I now suffer with every day, is too high of a price to pay for some silly illusion of pleasure I enjoyed once upon a time.  \\n  \\nI regret ever using crack cocaine, I deeply wish I had never tried it, and never used it the many times that I did.  At this point in my life I can say with a lot of certainty that I'll never use that drug ever again.  But it took me a lot of abuse and a lot of pain to come to the realization that the high just wasn't worth the suffering that came the next day and the following week, and the harm that it caused to my own life and those closest to me.  \\n  \\nI wish I didn't have the freedom to make those poor choices, I wish someone had stepped in on my behalf and intervened years ago, instead of recently as my family had to do to stop me from killing myself.  \\n  \\nI just want to help other people who are where I was and tell them what I know had to learn the hard way, to tell them \\\"it's not worth it, just don't do it, stop!\\\"  \\n  \\nI started off on marijuana, and then I got into mushrooms, mescaline, LSD and eventually cocaine, then my friends said to me \\\"try this, if you like cocaine, this high is 10 times better\\\" and so I tried crystal meth and that high was better, but then the next day I felt 100 times worse, and one day a friend of mine and I were doing powder cocaine and he whipped out a crack pipe and said to me \\\"if you like the powder cocaine, let's cook it up and smoke some, you'll like it!\\\" so I tried it and I was hooked on crack, of course we never called it crack because we cooked the powder ourselves, but eventually I started buying crack off the street.  \\n  \\nHopefully now you will see where I'm coming from.  I just want to help prevent pain and suffering of other people, I want to share with them what I've had to learn the hard way so they don't have to suffer the way I do today.  \",\"score\":-1.8195360195339991,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"[deleted]\",\"score\":0.0,\"sentiment\":\"neutral\"}","{\"comment\":\"Dude, as a Christian, all I can say is I'm really sorry.

In regards to the first quote, I was actually referring to the attitude of another conversationalist here as we were discussing this article, today. I often do that - I address people I'm conversing with as a group - because I usually pop in on reddit to challenge a consensus which I feel is in error.\\r\\n\\r\\nI see that you, as a scientist, are concerned about your field being on track. That's a very different atttude than I have. I am concerned about being successful in my own personal life. This is what my goal was, years ago, when I sat down and started reading some european philosophers, and then decided that I needed to take a cue from them, and start assessing things independently in the way they did.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I form my conclusions based on my own assessment of things. I think when it comes to knowledge about the mind, I trust the things that I can deduce and induce based on my own intimate experiences with my own mind, moreso than I trust some esoteric research that doesn't seem to my sensibilities, to be well conducted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I feel I have \\r\\n\\r\\n1. reached a conclusion \\r\\n\\r\\n2. and it has become fleshed out in my mind... \\r\\n\\r\\n3. and I've relied on it for some length of time  \\r\\n\\r\\n4. and I've seen more pieces of the puzzle fall into place, \\r\\n\\r\\n5. and I see the benefit I have for my own life from this realisation\\r\\n\\r\\n6. and I see other people with what I view as being a misguided consensus - which will do them, and our society, harm in the way it will lead to action\\r\\n\\r\\nonly then, will I start passionately contending the issue on a discussion board like reddit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI am not a specialist in any field, and I certainly don't intend to speak as one. At most, I intend to plant a seed. I want my realisation and my model to be considered, and if some scientist wants to use it as a hypothesis in a study, maybe then the facts of what I say can be borne out, and recognised eventually. I rarely find someone who can convince me that I am in error. There are often specific things where I don't have enough experience - and I may get some embarassing facts wrong, but the thrust of my assertion is not negated by those facts which I missed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll give you an example of seeding an idea. For years, I have recognised that children have more sensitive hearing than adults do. I remember my own hearing sensitivity changing in adolescence. I remembered how I used to be very distracted by the birds outside a cracked window when I was a kid. And I recognised that infant and toddler behavior sometimes reflects the fact that they have more sensitive ears. And I have a model for how their hearing is more sensitive - they have smaller eardrums, therefore quieter sounds can vibrate the eardrums more easily.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, one day, I read about this \\\"teenager sonic deterrent\\\" which first was marketed in Britain. I decided to write a piece up about this at a social news website - detailing my models about children's hearing. I received so much flak from commenters saying that I was talking pseudoscience. But, over the course of the ensuing months and years, scientists did do research using this hypothesis of kids having more sensitive ears... and as of 2009, this is common knowledge. Now, I'm not sure if my particular article had any effect in this process of seeding the idea - but I do think it is my personal obligation to share these things which I view as profound insights.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, you see, I'm not trying to replace science with philosophy. I'm trying to do my little part to augment the work of scientists, and to seed ideas that might take root in the blogosphere. In short, I am sharing what I view to be my insights and realisations.\\r\\n\",\"score\":3.2255952380970005,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"It depends on what kind of application you're talking about.\\n\\nMy laptop?

That, my friend, is human exploitation done, not only by the wealthy, but by peers to other peers.\\n\\nIf you really want to help a country like Indonesia, you can help the next generation by donating to organizations that will help educate the next generation.

Taking all your claims at face value, it looks like a lot has changed in FreeBSD security wise since I last checked - which wasn't quite as long ago as 2005, I don't think, but 2006 is probably a safe bet.  I did a fairly thorough security comparison of the 3 *BSDs around that time and have been carrying the results around in my head since.  In fact, I'll admit it's a bit worse than that - as a NetBSD user and fan I've followed new developments in that project much more closely than in the others, which I guess I've implicitly assumed to have stood still security-wise since my big check.  So I'm quite biased, I suppose.\\n\\nI agree with you on the general meaningless of \\\"number of security features\\\" as a metric.  Of course in general you can't argue something like \\\"Your OS has n security features and mine has n+1 so mine is more secure\\\".  That's far too simplistic, for all the reasons you mention.  But I think the reliability of the difference in feature count as a metric of relative security between two OSes probably tends toward something good as the difference gets quite large.  If one OS has 3 things that most knowledgable people would happily count as independent security features and the other has 20, it probably says something.\\n\\nOf course, this is no longer anything like the case with FreeBSD compared to NetBSD!\\n\\nI agree that ASLR and other exploit mitigation techniques are more speedbumps than properly architected solutions, but a gate with a speedbump infront of it is still more secure than a gate without one, so all else being equal it should still count for something.\\n\\nExternal file integrity checking (and I acknowledge that FreeBSD makes this super easy compared to Net or Open) is certainly a very good thing, but I still think veriexec is quite nice because not everybody has the luxury of being able to have a second machine around to check on their first.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks again for the update, perhaps it's time I gave FreeBSD another look.\",\"score\":6.158012820513999,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Falling didn't kill him -- it was the sudden stop (ground floor).\",\"score\":-0.875,\"sentiment\":\"negative\"}","{\"comment\":\"No.\\n\\nI find it impressive that I'm a unique coalescence of matter, in a completely unique configuration, at a unique point in time.

Any attempt to refute it, including taking an unspoken vow of silence, would be an attempt to refute my statement and thus you'd engage in argumentation.\\n\\nHmm...no, this doesn't quite work.  I take by \\\"can argue\\\" you mean that the person is capable of making statements in an attempt to refute your statement.  So silence itself wouldn't be proof that the person could argue; it would only proof if the intent of the silence was to refute your statement.  The other person could, for example, simply choose not to respond, which is not an argument, or not have heard you, or be unable to speak, or be silent for any number of reasons that aren't an argument.  You could also make your statement to a person who doesn't understand your language, or lacks the mental capacity to respond, or are prevented in some way from making an attempt at a refutation of your statement, so that their responses would not be arguments and would thus not prove your statement.  So not every response to your statement is proof of it.\\n\\nSo what you're saying is contingent on the responder's response being an argument.  You are saying, \\\"If you can make an argument in response, then you can make an argument\\\", which is a tautology, which only is true when you demonstrate that my response is in fact an argument.\\n\\n&gt;Consequently, a statement like \\\"torture is wrong\\\" does rest on firm footing in that the torturer, in torturing, does something that he would not want done upon himself.

You're leaving some steps out, I think.  What does it matter whether he would not want torture done on himself?  You're assuming the rule is the Golden Rule.  Why is that?  Why is he constrained to doing only things he would want done on himself?  A utilitarian, for instance, might say that torture is okay if it leads to a better result than refraining from it, regardless of whether the torturer would want to himself be tortured. Also, why doesn't it matter that his beliefs be logically consistent?  Why is logical consistency an element of morality?

But I really appreciate your comment.\\n\\nAnyway, I completely agree that being considered to be gifted can make it very hard to relate to others.  It often makes you feel very ridiculous, ironically, for pouring your intellectual and emotional energies into such abstract concepts rather than focusing on the material world and human relationships.\\n\\nI can't say I've come the same path as you have --- rather, I was always the underachiever who never won any academic merits besides having teachers tell me that I was gifted, had potential, and just needed to work harder.  Consequently the lack of academic merit never made me think I was particularly gifted, but since I started college I really began to see that I was a little different from a lot of people my age.  \\n\\nHowever, that isn't to say that I wasn't arrogant.  I think I knew that I was gifted and really took up some resentment at not being able to get the grades to prove it.\\n\\nBut also, as a girl, I feel like I'm already enough of an anomaly for being relatively intellectually oriented despite my bad grades.  I don't really want to be known as more of an overachiever than I kind of already am.  I never went to expensive private schools for very gifted children; I was always at relatively small suburban schools with a gifted program that was really just a place where conscientious versus genuinely brilliant children went.  I can't say I've ever really known what it's like to be around genuinely \\\"gifted\\\" people.\\n\\nAnyway, yeah, I agree with you about adulthood leveling it all out.  Nobody cares if you're smart or good-looking or whatever when you're out in the real world;  in the end (and maybe this is the really beautiful thing about life), all that matters is how hard you work and how kind you are to others.\\n\\nBut yeah, it does suck sometimes being so misunderstood, as cliche as that sounds.  It's difficult to have to try to cut yourself down just so others don't resent you for being special.\\n\\nTL;DR, I know!

Nutrients appear to be similar with the exception of a trend towards slightly higher vitamin C in organic food.[41]\\n\\n&gt;Only tentative conclusions can be drawn on the relative safety of organic food.

But I think that's a stupid definition of \\\"racist\\\".  I think a sensible definition of racist - for rational Bayesian people, of course - is having an unreasonable prior based on race.\\n\\nIf all people are equal across race with regards to some variable - say intelligence - then if your prior for someone's IQ based on their race is different from your prior without knowledge of their race then you are being racist - and, incidentally, irrational, by using a bad prior.  Racism can be sensibly defined as an irrational behaviour in which one chooses a prior for features given race which is not representative of observed reality.\\n\\nIf all people are not equal across race with regards to some value then a rational person *will* have a different prior for that variable based on race - but in situations where people genuinely are not all equal then there's no problem with this.  Calling this racist is stupid.  If you tell me that there's a person behind a closed door who was born in Japan and ask me what my prior distiribution over his hair colour is and I say it's very heavily weighted toward \\\"black\\\" then that's not racist of me - it's just observant.  Plenty of physical traits - skin colour, hair colour, hair shape, eye shape, breast size, height - simply *are* strongly correlated with race, and we shouldn't consider acknowledging this racist.

I tend to try to know what I'm talking about when it comes to IT security stuff, since I write about it professionally.\\n\\n&gt; In fact, I'll admit it's a bit worse than that - as a NetBSD user and fan I've followed new developments in that project much more closely than in the others, which I guess I've implicitly assumed to have stood still security-wise since my big check. So I'm quite biased, I suppose.\\n\\nKudos for recognizing the implicit bias.  That's more than most people can manage, by a long shot, and recognizing my own biases is, I have found, a quick way to learn.\\n\\nI don't really know very well how FreeBSD actually compares with NetBSD, mind you -- I just knew enough about FreeBSD to respond to what you said.  I wouldn't claim that FreeBSD security is in a better state than NetBSD's, since I don't actually know enough about NetBSD to make a meaningful comparison.  I brought up the fact it's the basis for the TrustedBSD project only to point out the security benefits that can be gained by selecting FreeBSD as the basis of a security-hardened OS for government use.\\n\\n&gt; But I think the reliability of the difference in feature count as a metric of relative security between two OSes probably tends toward something good as the difference gets quite large.\\n\\nI find that, just as *[there's more to security than counting vulnerabilities](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=268)*, there's also more to it than counting features.  In fact, if you really want to start looking at the results of counting [security features](http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/security/?p=376), it's worth noting that I think Microsoft Windows would probably \\\"win\\\" such a comparison.  The default and potential security of an OS is much more a matter of qualitative than quantitative analysis.  The authentication systems and basic, architectural privilege separation of any of the major open source BSD Unix systems alone are worth more than all of MS Windows' \\\"security features\\\" put together.\\n\\nOn the other hand . . . if two OSes are roughly equal *except* that one has three security features the other doesn't, that's definitely a point in favor of the system with more security features.  It just doesn't follow that one OS with thirty security features is necessarily better than another with eight, if they only have two of them in common.\\n\\n&gt; Of course, this is no longer anything like the case with FreeBSD compared to NetBSD!\\n\\nYeah, we're just talking hypotheticals at this point.\\n\\n&gt; I agree that ASLR and other exploit mitigation techniques are more speedbumps than properly architected solutions, but a gate with a speedbump infront of it is still more secure than a gate without one, so all else being equal it should still count for something.\\n\\nThis is true.  I didn't mean to say that all exploit mitigation techniques are mere speedbumps, though.  Some are *[rumble strips](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Rumble_strips)*, others are speed bumps, and still others are moats.  Meanwhile, some are anti-aircraft batteries.  No reasonable exploit mitigation functionality is 100% effective, but they're not all equal.  ASLR is kind of on the low end, in my estimation.\\n\\n&gt; External file integrity checking (and I acknowledge that FreeBSD makes this super easy compared to Net or Open)\\n\\nActually, I suspect it's pretty close between the three.  FreeBSD might make it marginally easier or, in some cases, *much* easier, depending on your specific integrity auditing needs.  I just find that kernel-level filesystem integrity auditing is kind of redundant when you do integrity auditing from outside the system in the vast majority of cases.\\n\\n&gt; I still think veriexec is quite nice because not everybody has the luxury of being able to have a second machine around to check on their first.\\n\\nI absolutely agree.  I doubt that would be very relevant to China's needs in this case, though -- or the US DoD's needs, if that organization were to get off its fourth point of contact and start investigating alternatives to off-the-shelf, one size fits all software.\\n\\n&gt; Anyway, thanks again for the update, perhaps it's time I gave FreeBSD another look.\\n\\nCool.\\n\\nUse what works for you, of course.  At the moment, I'm just happy to see people using an open source BSD Unix system instead of GNU/Linux systems, for a number of reasons -- and felt compelled to correct some mistaken impressions of FreeBSD security.\",\"score\":19.86391941392,\"sentiment\":\"positive\"}","{\"comment\":\"Your engine runs much more efficiently when up to temperature, and removing the thermostat significantly increases the time it takes to warm up.

Of course, this was pretty lame, so he started going by xekul, and I decided to go by nitsuj... much cooler.\\n\\nAlso in fashion at the time was to tack affiliations at the back of your name.  For instance, Quake Clans did this, so, in Quake I was Nitsuj[TPU].  When I made my first Slashdot username (after a bit of of trolling Slashdot), it was NitsujTPU.  I imagine that, had I registered sooner, I might be a member of the 4 digit UID club (I am a member of the 5 digit club).\\n\\nI really should get in touch with those guys more.  I think that Adam was the only one who really fully appreciated the impact of TPU on all of our lives when we all headed off to college.  Interestingly, a bunch of us are PhD students now, and I've actually mentioned to other guys in passing that I was a member, when I ask guys who knew Adam in undergrad about connections and whatnot.  I don't want to give away names and whatnot in case the guys don't want to be named, but we've had or have people at CMU, University of Washington, Harvard, Yale, Cornell and other top schools.

Adam and Eve had no original sin, and yet were able to sin.  Jesus (and Mary, but let's not enter *that* debate right now) had no original sin, and yet were able to sin.  Original sin comes with a sinful nature (\\\"concupiscence\\\" we Catholics would call it) but is not *necessary* for someone to be able to sin.\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; The sin switch it turned from the \\\"off\\\" position in humanity to the \\\"on\\\" position.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat switch was \\\"on\\\" as soon as God gave us a command.

It says that through Adam, *all* died.  The stain of original sin is that all of Adam's offspring are born without the supernatural life within them.  Adam was created by God and walked with God before his fall.  He saw God, he talked with God.  This was the supernatural life of friendship with God that Adam was given in order to enjoy himself and pass on to his children.  When Adam sinned, however, he lost this supernatural life of grace.  He not only lost it for himself, but he lost it for his posterity, like a man who squandered his inheritance.  The state of original sin is one in which we are born separated from God because we did not inherit from our father Adam the supernatural life which died in him when he sinned.\\r\\n\\r\\nEverything in the Bible indicates that this condition of separation from God is now the normal condition for humans to be born into, and it is by being united with Christ that we rectify this condition and are joined with God, the supernatural life of grace restored to us.

One perspective is to increase intelligence. We may use study aids and memorize and practice. A lot of intelligent people I know can memorize very well and quickly. I'd say I'm intelligent for being able to memorize quickly. The other perspective is privileging the smarts. Rather than memorizing or learning vocabulary, the focus in this perspective is in regards to how you put the things together. What use is it if I can memorize (insert subject) without understanding it? I find that those who do well in school balance the two.\\n\\nThere are classes designed to start with teaching you the vocabulary before they explain why. For example, chemistry.\\n\\nHaving that in mind, think about what you privilege when you learn. Does the prospect of memorizing to ace an exam sound enticing? Or does understanding the material and being able to apply yourself abstractly sound better?\\n\\nSuppose you have a \\\"hard\\\" class that is about abstraction and requires you to be smarter rather than intelligent. I'd say if everyone else is excelling, they are focusing more on understanding why things work they way they do. However, let's say you think the opposite. Everyone else then is excelling because it's about how well they memorize.\\n\\nThe third perspective and often overlooked is when you can balance the two. It shows that you need to be challenged. It shows that you are a genius with more potential than what the class has to offer.\\n\\nFor myself, I am good at memorizing. I'd say I am intelligent. I struggle at putting things together, but I find it challenging and fun (philosophy major with fun experiences in math and chem). Sometimes I'm smart :) I realize that when I know something and understand it, I carry myself very confidently. That shows a bit of genius wouldn't you say? I'd also say that there is a varying degree of genius. There is the renaissance or the specialized types.
